# Bank-Institution-Term-Deposit-Predictive-Model
The investment and portfolio department of a certain bank would want to be able to identify their customers who potentially would subscribe to their term deposits. Our goal is to come up with a robust predictive model that would help them identify customers who would or would not subscribe to their term deposit in the future.
The dataset should be downloaded from the UCI ML website and more details about the data can be read from the same website.Using Machine Learning Classification Algorithms to predict whether a customer subscribes to term deposits in order to increase their campaign efficiency.
